 def maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(self, grid):
        row, col = map(max, grid), map(max, zip(*grid))
        return sum(min(i, j) for i in row for j in col) - sum(map(sum, grid))

Notes
1. map() is always faster than for loop. Attention that map() is an iterable objects so we need to use list(map()) to generate and display all results
2. for x in iterable objects, it will call for 'iter(iterable objects)' to generate a iterator with a method .__next__() in each loop to change x.
3. usage of zip() and zip(*):
